# sidsjokes-chrome

A chrome extension that does what this [twitter bot](https://github.com/sidgonuts/sidsjokes) does.

Doing this so other people can submit bad jokes, and would also make it easier to
add jokes to queue - I don't want to type out http://captainsidd.com/sidsJokes everytime.

Also, it'd be cool to make a Chrome Extension.
